now lets update our dms to make them more persuasive and funny and misterious and unique and leading 

Good.

Now we’re entering psychological territory.

Your DM should NOT feel like:

“Hi, check my platform”

“Join Rallynex”

“We are a cause-based site”

That screams spam.

Your DM should feel like:

Observant

Slightly mysterious

Curious

Respectful

Different

You’re not pitching.

You’re starting tension.

🎯 The Structure of a High-Converting DM

Observation (prove you actually looked)

Pattern interrupt (unexpected line)

Curious hook

Soft invite (not pushy)

🔥 DM Style 1 — The Curious Observer

“I saw your Day 3 update.
Most people quit by Day 7.
You don’t look like most people.”

Pause.

Let them reply.

If they respond:

“Out of curiosity — are you documenting this somewhere long-term, or just here?”

Now you’ve opened the door.

😏 DM Style 2 — Slightly Mysterious

“Random question.
If Instagram disappeared tomorrow, where would your project live?”

This creates instant tension.

If they reply:

“That’s exactly why I’m building something for people documenting causes and progress.
Not fundraising-first. Story-first.”

Then:

“Would you want to see it?”

You never drop links first.

😂 DM Style 3 — Funny + Leading

“Be honest.
You didn’t start this project just to get 12 likes, did you?”

Let that sit.

Then:

“You’re building something real.
Real things deserve a home, not just a feed.”

Then:

“Curious — have you thought about documenting this as a cause?”

Now you’ve introduced the word naturally.

🧠 DM Style 4 — Reverse Psychology

“You might actually be too early for this.”

They’ll reply: “Too early for what?”

Then:

“I’m building a platform for people who are serious about documenting impact.
Not hype. Not trends. Real progress.”

Now they’re leaning in.

🎭 DM Style 5 — Playfully Dramatic

“This is going to sound dramatic…
but your project deserves better than disappearing into the algorithm.”

Pause.

“Have you thought about treating it like a cause instead of content?”

Now you’ve reframed their identity.

⚠️ Important: Don’t Over-Explain

Bad:

“Hi I’m the founder of Rallynex, a cause-driven storytelling platform…”

Too much.

Instead:

Curiosity → Conversation → Then link.

💡 The 3 Rules of DM Psychology

Never send the link in the first message.

Never sound like you're selling.

Make them feel chosen, not targeted.

🔥 Bonus: The Clean Close

When they show interest:

“It’s called Rallynex.
It’s where causes live long-term instead of dying in feeds.”

Then send link.

Short.
Confident.
No begging.

Now I’ll ask you something strategic:

Do you want Rallynex DMs to feel more:

Intellectual and sharp

Playful and bold

Calm and visionary

Or disruptive and controversial

Pick one personality.

Because consistency of tone builds brand gravity.




🎯 The Balanced Growth System (Phase 1: Get 20 Causes)
DAILY

✅ 1 Instagram post
✅ DM 10 targeted people
✅ Reply to every comment / engage

3–4x Per Week

✅ 1 Twitter thread (not daily — quality > quantity)

1x Per Week

✅ 1 Medium blog post (SEO + authority)

Now let’s break down WHY this works.

🔥 Instagram = Presence + Proof

1 post per day is enough.

Purpose:

Show you’re active

Show examples of causes

Show your philosophy (“Start your cause. Share your progress.”)

Give DM targets something to look at when they check your page

Do NOT overpost.
Consistency > volume.

📩 DM 10 Per Day = Real Growth Engine

This is the most important part.

If you DM 10 per day:

70 per week

280 per month

Even with:

10% response rate

3% conversion rate

You’ll still get users.

And more importantly:
You’ll learn what people actually think.

This is founder work.

🧵 Twitter Threads (3–4 per week)

Why not daily?

Because:

Threads should be thoughtful.

They should teach something about causes.

They should attract builders.

Example thread ideas:

“Why fundraising-first platforms fail new causes”

“The real reason good work goes unseen”

“Start your cause before you ask for money”

Each thread ends with:

“Start your cause. Share your progress. → Rallynex”

That’s it.

📝 Medium (1 per week)

Medium is:

SEO long-tail engine

Authority builder

Trust builder

Topics like:

“Why Most Causes Never Get Seen”

“The Problem With Fundraising-First Platforms”

“How to Document Your Cause Journey”

Always link back to Rallynex.

⚖️ The Ratio That Wins

Here’s the real breakdown:

DM = 60% of growth
Instagram = 20%
Twitter = 10%
Medium = 10%

Because:
Conversations build platforms.
Content supports conversations.

🚨 Important: Don’t Turn This Into Busy Work

Your goal is NOT:

Likes

Views

Impressions

Followers

Your goal is:

→ Causes started
→ Updates posted
→ People continuing their journey

Everything else is noise.

🧠 One Adjustment I Recommend

Instead of DMing random accounts, target:

People already documenting something

People posting progress threads

Small NGO leaders

Students building projects

Local organizers

Creators doing 30-day challenges

They already understand “journey”.

That’s your perfect user.

🧭 The Simple Daily Checklist

Every day:

□ Post 1 Instagram post
□ DM 10 targeted builders
□ Engage for 20 minutes
□ Improve 1 thing on Rallynex

That’s it.

Simple.
Repeatable.
Powerful.

If you want, next I can:

Help you define exactly who to DM first (very specific niche)

Or write your 5 best-performing DM templates

Or design your 30-day execution board

Tell me which one you want.



Perfect. You want search keywords to find the right people to DM.

You are NOT looking for random influencers.

You are looking for:

People already doing meaningful work and sharing progress.

🧵 Twitter/X Search Keywords

Use Advanced Search. Try:

"starting a project"
"launching something new"
"building something"
"community initiative"
"volunteer project"
"documenting my journey"
"day 1 of"
"progress update"


Also search:

#buildinpublic
#nonprofit
#volunteer
#communityproject
#startuplife


Filter by:
→ Latest
→ Smaller accounts
→ Real people (not brands)

🎯 What To Avoid

Avoid:

Huge influencers

Verified accounts

Accounts with 100k+ followers

People clearly just fundraising aggressively

You want:

200–5,000 follower accounts

Real people

Consistent updates

Something meaningful happening

💎 Bonus Trick (Very Powerful)

Search:

"Day 1"
"Week 1"
"Just started"


These are early-stage builders.

They are the most open to new platforms.

🧠 The Pattern You’re Hunting

You’re looking for someone who:

Is building something

Is posting progress

Doesn’t have massive reach

Would benefit from a clean place to document

That’s your Rallynex user.

If you want next, I can give you:

A filtering checklist (how to qualify before DM)

Or a 5-step DM flow sequence

But these keywords alone will unlock hundreds of prospect

## 📱 **FACEBOOK VIRAL POSTS (5 Examples)**

### **1. The "Secret Revealed" Post**
```
💥 97% of campaigns fail because of this one mistake.

(Hint: It's not about the money)

And the craziest part? It takes 30 seconds to fix.

Most creators never find out until it's too late.

Want me to reveal what it is? 👇

❤️ = I'll share the secret in comments
🔄 = Share with a creator who needs this
```

### **2. The "Shocking Stat" Post**
```
🚨 BREAKING: Campaigns with soundtracks raise 3x more money.

But here's what nobody tells you:

It's NOT about the music quality.

It's about triggering the right emotion.

We analyzed 500+ campaigns and found:

• Happy soundtracks = 25% more shares
• Emotional soundtracks = 40% more donations
• Upbeat soundtracks = 3x longer engagement

Tag a creator who needs to see this! 👇
```

### **3. The "Story Hook" Post**
```
"This campaign was at 2% for 3 weeks... then they changed ONE thing."

Suddenly:
• 48 hours later: 150% funded
• 200+ new supporters
• $5,000 over goal

What was the magic change?

They stopped asking for money.

Instead, they started inviting people to join a movement.

The exact words they used: [Image with text overlay]

Like if you want more story breakdowns! ❤️
```

### **4. The "Mystery" Post**
```
🤫 There's a hidden pattern in viral campaigns.

And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

It has nothing to do with:
• How big your following is
• How perfect your story is
• How much money you need

It's about the "3 Second Rule"

If you don't hook them in 3 seconds, you've lost them.

We found this pattern in 87% of successful campaigns.

Comment "TELL ME" and I'll DM you the pattern.
```

### **5. The "Social Proof" Post**
```
"Most embarrassing moment of my life... became my most successful campaign."

Maria was ready to give up.

Her campaign had $0 after 2 weeks.

Then she tried this weird trick...

24 hours later:
✅ $2,500 raised
✅ 84 new supporters
✅ Local news coverage

The trick? She stopped being "professional" and started being REAL.

Share if you believe authenticity beats perfection! ✨

## 🐦 **TWITTER VIRAL THREADS (5 Examples)**

### **1. The "Secret They Don't Want You to Know" Thread**
```
1/6 🚨 I analyzed 1,000+ campaigns and found a secret pattern.

Big platforms don't want you to know this.

It could make your campaign go viral overnight.

Here's what I discovered: 👇

2/6 The most successful campaigns DON'T focus on money.

They focus on one thing: STORY MILESTONES.

Instead of "We need $5,000"
They say "We're at 25% - join the first 50 supporters!"

3/6 This works because of "Social Proof Psychology"

People want to join movements, not fund strangers.

When you show progress, you're not begging - you're leading.

4/6 The exact formula:
• 25% = "Join our first supporters"
• 50% = "We're halfway - be part of the momentum"
• 75% = "Help us cross the finish line"
• 100% = "You made this happen - what's next?"

5/6 One creator used this and went from $200 to $5,000 in 48 hours.

The secret isn't your story - it's how you frame progress.

6/6 Like this?

```

### **2. The "Mistake Exposed" Thread**
```
1/5 🤯 The #1 mistake killing your campaign isn't what you think.

It's not your photos, story, or goal amount.

It's your UPDATES.

Most creators update wrong. Here's how to fix it: 👇

2/5 Bad update: "Thanks for the donations!"
Good update: "WE just hit 25%!  Sarah's $20 got us here"

See the difference?
One is gratitude. The other is momentum.

3/5 The psychology:
People don't want to be thanked - they want to see their impact.

Show names. Show progress. Show what THEIR support achieved.

4/5 Example of viral update:
"Because of Mark's $50, we can now buy 10 trees!
We're at 40% - 12 more supporters like Mark and we hit our goal!"

This isn't asking - it's showing momentum.

5/5 Retweet if you'll try this in your next update! 🔥

### **3. The "Data Story" Thread**
```
1/6 📊 I tracked 500 campaigns for 30 days.

The results will surprise you.

Campaigns that used SOUNDTRACKS:
• Raised 3.2x more money
• Got 5x more shares
• Had 70% higher completion rates

Here's why: 👇

2/6 Soundtracks trigger emotional memory.

Hear a song → feel an emotion → remember a cause.

It's neuroscience, not magic.

3/6 But the WRONG soundtrack can kill your campaign.

Sad music = pity donations (one-time)
Hopeful music = movement building (ongoing)

Choose your emotion carefully.

4/6 Best performing soundtracks by category:
• Environmental = uplifting instrumental
• Education = hopeful acoustic
• Emergency = urgent but optimistic

5/6 Real example:
@RiverCleanup used a hopeful soundtrack and raised 4x their goal.

The music made people feel like change was POSSIBLE.

6/6 Like this data?
Retweet to share with creators! ♻️

Follow for more data-driven campaign tips.
```

### **4. The "Controversial Take" Thread**
```
1/5 🚫 Hot take: Your campaign doesn't need more followers.

It needs better STORYTELLING.

I've seen campaigns with 50 followers raise $10,000.

While others with 10,000 followers raise $200.

Here's why: 👇

2/5 People don't support CAUSES.

They support STORIES.

"Help save the environment" = weak
"Join me in planting 100 trees in our local park" = strong

3/5 The formula:
• Specific goal (not vague)
• Tangible impact (see results)
• Emotional connection (feel something)

4/5 Example makeover:
BEFORE: "Support education in Africa"
AFTER: "Help 50 girls in Kenya go to school for one year"

One is a concept. The other is a movie waiting to happen.

5/5 Agree? Retweet!
Disagree? Reply with why!

1/4 ⚡ 5 quick fixes that can 10x your campaign today:

(No extra followers needed)

2/4 1. Add a countdown
"48 hours left" creates urgency
"Join before time runs out" > "Please donate"

3/4 2. Use donor names
"Thanks to Sarah's $20, we're at 25%"
Names make it personal and social

4/4 3. Show visual progress
Progress bars work, but VIDEO updates work better

Show the impact, don't just tell it.

That's it!
Like & Retweet if you found this helpful! 🔥

Perfect! I’ll do both: create a **ready-to-post 7-day Instagram calendar** for Rallynex causes, and clarify the CTA thing.

---

### **Quick answer about CTAs:**

* Every post should ideally have **some kind of CTA (call-to-action)**.
* It **doesn’t always have to be a donation link**—especially for engagement posts.
* Example CTAs by post type:

  1. **Educational posts:** “Save this tip → link in bio” or “Tag someone who needs this”
  2. **Engagement posts / polls / questions:** “Comment below” or “Vote in our poll”
  3. **Success stories:** “Support a cause like this → link in bio”
  4. **Behind-the-scenes / planning posts:** “Tell us what you’d like to see next!”

✅ Bottom line: every post should **either inspire action or a response**, but the action can be small (like a comment, a share, a save) if not asking for direct support.
